# :material-file-outline: Data Files 

The average data point values used to generate a simulation-based projection use the past 8-weeks county-level data on reported COVID-19 cases and several metrics around hospitalization due to COVID-19. In particular, the data files used are as follows: 

- [Hospital occupancy]() 
- [COVID-19 cases]()
- [COVID-19 forecast]()


In the below sections, each data file, in turn, is explained. The involvement of each file in generating a simulation-based projection is also discussed.

## Hospital occupancy 

Simulations use the latest county-level data on reported COVID-19 cases,  hospitalizations due to COVID-19, and a four-week county-level forecast on expected COVID-19 cases. In particular, the variables used during a simulation are as follows: 

- The average of all non-ICU admissions at the county-level 
- The average length of stay (LOS ) for all  ICU and non-ICU patients at the county-level 
- The average occupancy  for all  ICU and non-ICU patients at the county-level 
- The average admissions net change for ICU patients at the county-level 


!!! note 

    The variables mentioned above retrospect eight weeks.
