# :material-chart-timeline-variant: Simulation Flow 

The flow of a simulation which subsequently generates a simulation-based projection can be summarized in the following sequential steps: 


- [Step 1: Select state and county](#step-1-select-state-and-county) 
- [Step 2: Review or customize input data](#step-2-review-or-customize-input-data) 
- [Step 3: Review simulation-based projection](#step-3-review-simulation-based-projection)
- [Step 4 (optional): Adjust simulation to reflect best- and worst-case alternatives](#step-4-optional-adjust-simulation-to-reflect-best-and-worst-case-alternatives)

In the below sections, each step, in turn, is explained in detail. 

## Step 1: Select state and county 

The COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator (CHOS) provides simulation-based projections supported with state-of-the-art forecasting models and the latest county-level data on the reported positive cases and hospitalizations. A simulation-based projection includes: 

- ==A hospital-level four-week projection of expected ICU and non-ICU hospital-level admissions and occupancy for COVID-19 patients, as well,==

- ==A county-level four-week projection of expected county-level COVID-19 cases used to generate the hospital-level four-week projection==

Therefore, starting a simulation requires selecting the state and county in which the hospital resides.

## Step 2: Review or customize input data 

The simulation generates a hospital-level four-week projection by averaging particular data points and using the results of those averages (county-level data points) to generate the projection. Accordingly, it might be the case that a particular hospital might not correspond with the average county-level data points to generate the hospital-level projection. It could be the case that a hospital in the selected county might have above or below-average values for the data points used to generate the hospital-level projections. Accordingly, hospitals can change such data points before generating hospital-level four-week projections. 

Overrides enable hospitals to use data point values that reflect specific characteristics of the hospital. 

- To learn how a hospital can change the average data points through data overrides, see 

- To learn about the particular county-level data points that are average, see

## Step 3: Review simulation-based projection

## Step 4 (optional): Adjust simulation to reflect best- and worst-case alternatives
