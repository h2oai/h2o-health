# :material-chart-box-outline: Charts


Simulate offers several interactive and simple charts to understand a projection. The following charts are available when Simulate generates a projection: 

- [Four-week projection on local county COVID-19 cases]()
- [Length of stay, non-ICU]() 
- [Length of stay, ICU]()
- [Occupancy and admissions, non-ICU]()
- [Occupancy and net change, ICU]()

In the below sections, each chart, in turn, is explained in detail.
