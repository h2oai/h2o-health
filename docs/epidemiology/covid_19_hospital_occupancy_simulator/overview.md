# COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator

The COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator (CHOS) application enables hospitals to prepare for patient surges due to COVID-19. Through simulations supported with state-of-the-art forecasting models and the latest county-level data on the reported COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19, CHOS produces simulation-based projections containing a hospital-level four-week projection of expected ICU and non-ICU admissions and occupancy for COVID-19 patients. The simulation-based projection also includes the four-week county-level forecast on expected COVID-19 cases used to generate the hospital-level four-week projections.

Hospitals can better customize the models' data to reflect a hospital's specific characteristics through available data overrides; overrides based on expectations about the future allow you to play out different scenarios and generate alternative projections.

With the insights, simulation-based projections provide during public health emergencies like the one we currently experience, CHOS makes the process of managing hospital resources more efficient and less complicated.
