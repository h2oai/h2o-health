# COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator ([CHOS](./terminology.md#chos-covid-19-hospital-occupancy-simulator]))


The COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator ([**CHOS**](./terminology.md#chos-covid-19-hospital-occupancy-simulator])) application enables hospitals to prepare for patient surges due to COVID-19. Through simulations supported with state-of-the-art forecasting models and the latest county-level data on the reported COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19, [**CHOS**](./terminology.md#chos-covid-19-hospital-occupancy-simulator]) produces [simulation-based projections](./terms.md#simulation-based-projection) containing a hospital-level four-week projection that includes:

- Daily expected non-ICU occupancy and admissions for COVID-19 patients 
- Daily expected ICU occupancy and net change admissions for COVID-19 patients 

The [simulation-based projection](./terms.md#simulation-based-projection) also includes the four-week county-level forecast on expected COVID-19 cases used to generate the hospital-level four-week projections.

Hospitals can better customize the models' data to reflect a hospital's specific characteristics and future expectations through data override; overrides based on expectations about the future allow you to play out different scenarios and generate alternative projections.

With the insights [simulation-based projections](./terms.md#simulation-based-projection) can provide during public health emergencies like the one we currently experience, CHOS makes the process of managing hospital resources more efficient and less complicated.


## Audience 

Nursing staff, hospital managers, and hospital leadership

## Background 

As the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates, hospital and ICU capacity management is vulnerable to public health emergencies. While avoiding that bed and consumable availability becomes scarce during times of need, managers need to ensure the facility is not maintaining and manning an unsustainably large excess of resources for prolonged periods at a time. During pandemic events like the one we currently experience, a manager (or anyone) can't predict:

1. The infection rate at the specific facility's service area
2. How the demand for beds will come in waves
3. The onset and regional magnitude 

[**CHOS**](./terminology.md#chos-covid-19-hospital-occupancy-simulator]) offers a robust solution for capacity management of hospital and ICU beds. 
## Access
