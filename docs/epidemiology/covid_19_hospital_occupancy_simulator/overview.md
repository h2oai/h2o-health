# COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator

The COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator (CHOS) app enables hospitals to prepare for patient surges due to COVID-19. Through simulations supported with state-of-the-art forecasting models and the latest county-level data on the reported COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, CHOS produces hospital-level four-week projections of expected ICU and non-ICU admissions and occupancy for COVID-19 patients. Additionally, CHOS offers the four-week county-level forecast on expected COVID-19 cases used to generate the hospital-level four-week projections.

You can customize the data to reflect better the specific characteristics of a hospital through available data overrides. Overrides based on expectations about the future allow you to play out different scenarios and generate alternative projections.

With the insights these projections provide during public health emergencies like the one we currently experience, CHOS makes the process of managing hospital resources more efficient and less complicated.

## Audience
