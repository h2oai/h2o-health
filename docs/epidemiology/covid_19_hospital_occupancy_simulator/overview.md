# COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator

Through a simulation supported with state-of-the-art time series models and real-time data, *Simulate* enables hospital staff to obtain a four-week projection on their COVID-19 ICU and non-ICU hospital occupancy, admission, and length of stay (LOS). In the projection, *Simulate* includes a four-week estimate on local county COVID-19 cases. You can understand a projection through simple and interactive charts.

To provide total control over the data used to generate a projection, hospital staff can override the data feeding the models. 

With the critical information a projection can provide during public health emergencies like the one we currently experience, managing hospital resources becomes less complicated and more precise when we know what is ahead.

*Simulate: prepare strategically ahead of time.*

## Audience 

Hospital staff (e.g., hospital managers, hospital leadership, etc.)

## Access 

Simulate is available on the H2O Cloud. To learn how to access it, see [Access H2O Health Apps]().
