# :book: Terms 

The *COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator* (**CHOS**) uses several terms across its documentation, and each, in turn, is explained in the below sections.


## Simulation-based projection 

A simulation-based projection includes: 

- A **hospital-level** four-week projection of expected ICU and non-ICU admissions and occupancy for COVID-19 patients, as well,

- A **county-level** four-week projection of expected COVID-19 cases used to generate the **hospital-level** four-week projection

## Average length of Stay (LOS) 

In the medical field, LOS stands for *length of stay*. In other words, it refers to how long a patient stays in a hospital as a patient.
