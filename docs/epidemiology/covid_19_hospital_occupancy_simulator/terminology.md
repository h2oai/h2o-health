The *COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator* (**CHOS**) uses several terms across its documentation, and each, in turn, is explained in the below sections.



## CHOS

CHOS stands for *COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator*. The name of the application. 

## Simulation-based projection 

A simulation-based projection includes: 


- A ==**hospital-level**== four-week projection that includes the following metrics for COVID-19 patients:

	- Daily expected non-ICU occupancy and admissions 
	- Daily expected ICU occupancy and admissions net change 

- A ==**county-level**== four-week projection of expected COVID-19 cases used to generate the ==**hospital-level**== four-week projection

## LOS

LOS stands for *length of stay*. In other words, it refers to how long a patient stays in a hospital as an inpatient.
