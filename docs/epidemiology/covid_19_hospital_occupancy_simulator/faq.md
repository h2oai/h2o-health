# :material-frequently-asked-questions: FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions 
 

Through simulations supported with state-of-the-art time series models and real-time data, *COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator* (CHOS) enables hospital staff to obtain four-week projections on their COVID-19 ICU and non-ICU hospital occupancy, admission, and length of stay (LOS). Plus, *CHOS* includes a four-week estimate on local county COVID-19 cases in the projections. You can understand projections through simple and interactive charts.

To provide total control over the data used to generate a projection, hospital staff can override the data feeding the models. 

With the critical information, a projection can provide during public health emergencies like the one we currently experience, managing hospital resources becomes less complicated and wasteful when we know what is ahead.
