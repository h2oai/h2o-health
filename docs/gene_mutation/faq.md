# :material-frequently-asked-questions: FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions 


Gene Mutation AI (GMA) is an application by H2O.ai and supported by Snowflake that enables participants around genomics to use a patient's gene sequence variations data (VCF files) to: 

1. Evaluate on-demand a patient's risk for a particular disease determined by an appropriate uploaded model built-in Driverless AI. 
2. Identify the ten most influential genes that influence a model's risk prediction for a specific disease.
3. Understand how common a disease risk has been among past patients. 
4. Compare a patient's disease risk to that of previously evaluated patients. 
5. Store and process efficiently and reproducibly thousands of genetic results in parallel.

GMA, as a result, eases the process of processing, analyzing, and storing a patient's gene sequence variations data while generating on-demand disease prognoses.

## General 

### How can I use the *Gene Mutation AI* application? 

The *Gene Mutation AI* application is available on the [H2O AI Cloud](https://cloud.h2o.ai/login?referer=%2F) (HAIC). If you have access to HAIC but are still having trouble finding or running the app, see [Accessing H2O Health Apps](../../access_h2o_health_apps.md).
