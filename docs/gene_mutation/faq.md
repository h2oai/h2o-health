# :material-frequently-asked-questions: FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions 


H2O Gene Mutation AI is a machine learning-powered patient risk assessment application that uses the Snowflake Data Cloud.

Using information about the presence of genic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in samples derived from patient samples, the application allows the user to:

1. Convert VCF files to a dataset that is suitable for machine learning (H2O-3 ©).
2. Evaluate patient risk and understand how common this risk has been among past patients (H2O Driverless AI © AutoML).
3. Find and explore similar patients (H2O-3 ©). 
4. Identify the genes that influence patient risk (H2O Driverless AI © MLI).


This solution combines the Snowflake database, with H2O Cloud to bring:

- Intelligent clinical decision support directly to clinicians.
- Advanced analytics for pharmacogenomics and pharmacovigilance pipelines.

## General 

### How can I use the Gene Mutation AI app? 

The Gene Mutation AI app is available on the [H2O AI Cloud](https://cloud.h2o.ai/login?referer=%2F) (HAIC). If you have access to HAIC but are still having trouble finding or running the app, see [Accessing H2O Health Apps](../../access_h2o_health_apps.md).
