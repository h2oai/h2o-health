# :material-medical-bag: How do prognoses work? 

To generate a disease risk prognostic for a patient or a cohort of patients, you will need to follow the following sequential steps: 

- [Step 1:](#step-1-import-datasets) Import Datasets
- [Step 2:](#step-2-run-predictions) Run Predictions
- [Step 3:](#step-3-view-results) View Results

In the below sections, each step, in turn, is explained in detail.

## Step 1: Import Datasets

Datasets can be [uploaded](/gene_mutation/datasets/#upload-dataset) or [imported via Snowflake](/gene_mutation/snowflake/). In either case the following steps remain the same.

## Step 2: Run Predictions

[Running a prediction](/gene_mutation/predictions/#running-a-prediction) requires you to fill out the fields in the "Generate Patient Prognosis" panel. After that you only need to click "Predict" and wait for the prediction to finish.

## Step 3: View Results

After the prediction is finished running, you will see a [table of results](/gene_mutation/predictions/#predictions-workflow) appear in the main panel. From there you can click on a patient to view a variety of [data visualizations](/gene_mutation/predictions/#patients-page) related to their prognosis.
