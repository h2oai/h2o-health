# :material-chart-box-outline: Charts

You can understand a projection through several interactive and simple charts. The following charts are available when a simulation generates a [simulation-based projection](./terminology.md#simulation-based-projection): 

- [New COVID Cases: 4-Weeks Projection (county-level)](#new-covid-cases-4-weeks-projection-county-level)
- [Occupancy and admissions, non-ICU](#occupancy-and-admissions-non-icu)
- [Occupancy and net change, ICU](#occupancy-and-net-change-icu)
- [Length of stay, non-ICU](#length-of-stay-non-icu) 
- [Length of stay, ICU](#length-of-stay-icu)


In the below sections, each chart, in turn, is explained in detail. 

## New COVID Cases: 4-Weeks Projection (county-level)

This chart provides a county-level four-week projection of expected COVID-19 cases.

!!! note 

    This county-level four-week projection of expected COVID-19 cases uses the CDC county-level ensemble model. To learn more, see [CDC County-Level Ensemble Model](./models.md#cdc-county-level-ensemble-model).
## Occupancy and admissions, non-ICU

This chart provides a hospital-level four-week projection of expected occupancy and admissions for non-ICU COVID-19 patients. We can observe the hospital-level past 8-weeks occupancy and admissions rate to the left of the vertical dash line. And to the right of the dashed line, we can observe the hospital-level four-week projection.

## Occupancy and net change, ICU

This chart provides a hospital-level four-week projection of expected occupancy and net-change admissions for ICU COVID-19 patients. We can observe the hospital-level past 8-weeks occupancy and net-change admissions rate to the left of the vertical dash line. And to the right of the dashed line, we can observe the hospital-level four-week projection.

## Length of stay, non-ICU

This histogram provides a nationwide (USA) random average sample of the length of stay (LOS) for non-ICU COVID-19 patients.

## Length of stay, ICU

This histogram provides a nationwide (USA) random average sample of the length of stay (LOS) for ICU COVID-19 patients.
