In the H2O AI Cloud (HAC), you can access an H2O Healthcare app through an instance of the app. Note An instance runs with 1 GPU by default unless configured differently by your admin: contact your admin if you need more resources. Access HAC (H2O AI Cloud) Step 1: Access your account Access your H2O AI Cloud account. App Instance Step 2: Search bar In the H2O AI Cloud search bar, search name_of_app : Now, select the name_of_app tile, the app instance page appears containing details about name_of_app. Step 3: name_of_app Details Page To start a name_of_app instance, click Run App : Step 4: name_of_app Instance Now, the H2O AI Cloud is starting an instance of name_of_app for you. While you have a starting/running instance, the Run App button will change its name to Go to Instance . To open the app in a new tab, click Go to Instance : Note In the name_of_app instance, several items will be installed. Right after, you will be able to use name_of_app. All items are automatically installed when you start an instance. Step 5: Pause or Terminate Instance An instance of name_of_app can be paused or terminated. Pausing the instance saves computational time and resources. Terminating an instance will delete the instance permanently. Note Customers pay for H2O AI Cloud via AI Units so that as they consume more resources, they pay more. By default, each instance of name_of_app takes 4 AI Units. To pause instance To terminate instance In the H2O AI Cloud menu, select My Instances : Locate your name_of_app instance row. Click Pause . You can also Pause the instance in the App Details page where you clicked Run App : In the App Details page, click the App Instances tab. Locate your instance row. Click Pause : In the H2O AI Cloud menu, select My Instances . Locate your name_of_app instance row. Click Down Arrow . Click Terminate . You can also Terminate the instance in the App Details page where you clicked Run App : In the App Details page, click the App Instances tab. Locate your instance row. Click Down Arrow .
