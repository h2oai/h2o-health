<h1 class="home-page-title">H2O Health Documentation</h1>

At <a href="https://h2o.ai/solutions/industry/health/" target="_blank" >H2O Health</a> we build AI apps that solve complex healthcare and life science problems. We are co-innovating with major healthcare organizations to address long-standing and emerging challenges. Many of these solutions are currently offered in preview at the Healthcare H2O.ai Appstore (<a href="https://cloud.h2o.ai/login?referer=%2F" target="_blank" >H2O AI Cloud - HAIC</a>) and are documented here alongside detailed instructions on their use.
