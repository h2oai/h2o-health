# COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator

Using state-of-the-art time series models and real-time data, Simulate enables hospital staff to obtain a four-week projection on their COVID-19 ICU and non-ICU hospital occupancy, admission, and length of stay (LOS). As well, in the projection, Simulate includes a four-week projection on local county COVID-19 cases. You can understand a projection through simple and interactive charts. 

To provide total control over the data used to generate a projection, hospital staff can override the data feeding the models. 

With the critical information, a projection can provide during public health emergencies like the one we currently experience, managing hospital resources becomes less complicated but more precise when we know what is ahead. 

*Simulate: prepare strategically ahead of time.*
