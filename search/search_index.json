Step 1: Select state and county Step 2: Review or customize input data Step 3: Review simulation-based projection Step 1: Select state and county \u00b6 The COVID-19 Hospital Occupancy Simulator ( CHOS ) provides hospitals with a simulation-based projection supported with state-of-the-art forecasting models and the latest county-level data on the reported positive cases and metrics around COVID-19 hospitalizations. A simulation-based projection includes: A hospital-level four-week projection that includes the following metrics for COVID-19 patients: Daily expected non-ICU occupancy and admissions Daily expected ICU occupancy and admissions net change A county-level four-week projection of expected COVID-19 cases used to generate the hospital-level four-week projection Therefore, when preparing a simulation for the first time, hospitals need to specify their county and the county's state. Note To learn how to start a simulation, see Start Simulation . To learn how the county-level four-week projection of expected COVID-19 cases is generated, see CDC County-Level Ensemble Model . The state-of-the-art forecasting models rely on certain assumptions to effectively generate a simulation-based projection . To learn more, see Modeling Assumptions . Step 2: Review or customize input data \u00b6 To generate a hospital-level four-week projection, the models use certain variables that obtain an average value by computing county-level data from the past four weeks around hospitalization metrics. At times, it could be the case that a hospital might not agree with the average values because the hospital knows to have above or below-average values (e.g., big vs. small hospitals in the same county). This perceived difference will often occur among big and small hospitals when county-level averages will not correspond. Therefore: Before starting a simulation, hospitals can modify the average values given to the model's variables through data overrides known as personalized hospital overrides. Through these overrides, CHOS enables hospitals to use their perceived average values while considering the specific characteristics of the hospital. To learn about the available personalized hospital overrides, see Overrides: personalized hospital . On top of the personalized hospital overrides, hospitals can introduce certain overrides based on expectations about the future to play out different scenarios and generate a modified simulation-based projection . The data overrides that enable hospitals to modify future averages are referred to as future expert estimate overrides. To learn more, see Adjust simulation to reflect best- and worst-case alternatives . Note To learn about the particular county-level data points that are averaged to generate a hospital-level four-week projection, see Data Files . Step 3: Review simulation-based projection \u00b6 After the simulation-based projection is generated, the following interactive and simple charts will appear: For the hospital-level four-week projection, the following charts are available: Occupancy and admissions, non-ICU Occupancy and net change, ICU Length of stay, non-ICU Length of stay, ICU For the county-level four-week projection used to generate the hospital-level four-week projection, the following chart is available: New COVID Cases: 4-Weeks Projection (county-level) After a simulation-based projection is generated, hospitals can introduce certain overrides based on expectations about the future to play out different scenarios and generate an alternative simulation-based projection . The data overrides that enable hospitals to modify future averages are referred to as future expert estimate overrides. To learn more, see Adjust simulation to reflect best- and worst-case alternatives . Note To learn more about the charts and their interpretation, see Charts . Adjust simulation to reflect best- and worst-case alternatives \u00b6 Using one of the future expert estimate overrides enables hospitals to change a four-week simulation-based projection while taking into consideration the used future expert estimate overrides. Example One of the available overrides enables hospitals to select a hospital-level average of future expected COVID-19 cases per week. This override allows hospitals to clearly understand the implications of an increasing or decreasing surge of COVID-19 cases within their facilities.

At times, it could be the case that a hospital might not agree with the average values because the hospital knows to have above or below-average values (e.g., big vs. small hospitals in the same county). This perceived difference will often occur among big and small hospitals when county-level averages will not correspond. Therefore: Before starting a simulation, hospitals can modify the average values given to the model's variables through data overrides known as personalized hospital overrides. Through these overrides, CHOS enables hospitals to use their perceived average values while considering the specific characteristics of the hospital. To learn about the available personalized hospital overrides, see Overrides: personalized hospital . On top of the personalized hospital overrides, hospitals can introduce certain overrides based on expectations about the future to play out different scenarios and generate a modified simulation-based projection . The data overrides that enable hospitals to modify future averages are referred to as future expert estimate overrides.

Audience \u00b6 GMA is intended for participants around genomics (e.g., clinicians) Note GMA assumes that basic knowledge of genomics has been acquired to build new predictive disease models. Background \u00b6 A medical professional often considers a patient's genetic makeup to generate a medical diagnosis and discover the appropriate drug for a certain disease. For instance, observing someone's genetic makeup can determine someone's predisposition to a certain type of cancer or heart disease. Looking at a patient's genetic makeup cannot only shed light on someone's likelihood of developing a genetic disease but can also help determine the appropriate pharmaceutic intervention. Before a medical professional or others can use the genetic data, the data needs to be processed, which is often a challenge. Unfortunately, processing the genetic data is not the only problem; problems during the analysis process of the genetic data make it complicated to use the data effectively. In essence, the pharmacogenomics and pharmacovigilance pipelines are currently dealing with a complicated process of preprocessing and analyzing a patients genetic data.

In the Snowflake Model list, select one of the available models from the Snowflake stage. Note Beyond the available models, you can upload your model. To learn how to upload your model, see Upload model . The delay after this step is because the application looks to tables that match this model and generates SQL dynamically based on the model. Otherwise, the user may not know which table(s) to use for a specific model. In the Snowflake Table box, select one of the available Snowflake tables that match the selected model. Click Predict . Note After generating predictions, you can start all over. To start all over and generate fresh predictions: In the Predictions Workflow card, click Restart . Upload model \u00b6 If you don't want to use one of the available models in the default Snowflake stage, you can upload a new model. To upload a new model, consider the following instructions: In the Gene Mutation AI menu, click Predictions . In the Experiment Name box, enter a name for the experiment. Click Browse... . Click Upload an experiment . Note The model you upload should refer to the experiment .zip file generated by H2O Driverless AI when a model is trained. Overwrite model \u00b6 To overwrite an uploaded model, consider the following instructions: When uploading a model , select the Overwrite experiment (if exists) checkbox. Prediction(s) table \u00b6 You can view a generated disease prediction for a patient or a set of disease predictions for a cohort of patients in the prediction(s) table. The prediction(s) table can be viewed when the prediction(s) are complete. The columns of the prediction(s) table are as follows: Column Description [TARGET.1] Risk A prediction in a percentage format that has been scaled from a classification probability using an isotonic regression [PLOT] Risk A link to a description prognosis containing plots and graphs PATIENT_ID The numerical ID identifying a particular patient H2OPREDICTION Both classification probabilities (1 or 0) H2OSHAPLEY The values for all local and global features that are rendered in the patient's Shapley plot Note The above columns are not the only ones; besides those above, you will find several other columns that refer to the feature names and values from the patient's data (genes). View individual prediction \u00b6 To view detailed explanations into a prediction, consider the following instructions: In the Predictions(s) table , identify the prediction row you want to view, click Explore this patient\u2019s result . Note To learn about the graph and chart explanations of a prediction (prognosis), see Prediction graphs and plots . Drift Detection \u00b6 Any time a new prediction or a set of predictions are generated, you can observe whether data drift was detected. To see whether the data of a prediction drifted from the one the used model used, consider the following instructions: Click the Drift Detection expander arrow when viewing an individual prediction . Note In general, drift detection indicates whether the patient cohort or single patient is consistent with the trained model. The underlying model could be less reliable if drift is detected, and you should take specific maintenance actions. The absence of drift is evident that the model has the same performance during training. Prediction graphs and plots \u00b6 Certain graphs and plots are provided to clarify and understand a prediction. Such graphs and plots are as follows: Gauge Shapley graph Histogram Sankey plot Radar plot Note These graphs and plots evaluate a patient's risk, the most significant genes contributing to the reported risk, and a gene-by-gene comparison to similar patients. It also offers metrics to identify potential anomalies that might be of concern. Gauge \u00b6 The Gauge indicates whether the patient has been predicted to be predisposed for HIGH or LOW risk to the disease the selected model classifies. As well, within the Gauge, a prediction value is displayed. Note Above the Gauge, a text explanation is provided, identifying the determinant gene name for the prediction value. Shapley graph \u00b6 The Shapley graph shows the patient\u2019s genetic contribution to the reported risk (grey) compared to the average contributions across the cohort (yellow). Grey bars: local Yellow bars: global Each bar is one gene of the top 10 most contributing genes for a particular patient. The Shapley bars can be positive or negative (opposite directions), indicating a high or low-risk contribution, respectively. Histogram \u00b6 The histogram displays an evaluation of how confident you should be in declaring a patient with a specific risk score ( Gauge ) as HIGH or LOW-RISK . Few points: The histogram can also present how risk is distributed across an entire patient cohort. LOW RISK is marked with green and HIGH RISK with red. Gene Mutation AI will mark the prediction value for the in view patient with a red/green ping. The further right a HIGH RISK patient is, the better one can feel about the given prediction. On the other side, the further left a LOW RISK patient is, the better. Sankey plot \u00b6 The Sankey plot helps you understand the patient profile. The plot displays the groups of patients ( HIGH or LOW-RISK or UNCERTAIN ) with which the selected patient is most similar. A mixture of different groups of similar patients indicates that the patient has diverged from the average assigned risk group. Note The 20 most similar patients are selected using a similarity algorithm on all the cohort genes. Radar plot \u00b6 The radar plot explains the gene-level similarities and differences between the selected patient and the 20 most similar patients in the cohort. The results are presented comparatively for the different risk groups. A group can be selected or deselected by clicking on the corresponding label at the plot\u2019s legend. Patient (prediction) data \u00b6 When viewing the graphs and plots of a prediction, you can also see the features and values used for scoring.
